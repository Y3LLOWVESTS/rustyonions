//! Broadcast event bus for the microkernel.
//!
//! Design goals (per Final Blueprint):
//! - Cloneable, bounded, non-blocking bus built on tokio::broadcast.
//! - Never block the kernel: on pressure, receivers may lag; we *observe* that,
//!   increment metrics later (next PR), and publish a *throttled* crash-style event.
//! - Keep the public surface compatible with existing subscribers that call
//!   `bus.subscribe()` and `rx.recv().await`.
//!
//! This file introduces *optional* lag-aware receiving via the helper
//! [`recv_lag_aware`] that you can adopt incrementally in services.
