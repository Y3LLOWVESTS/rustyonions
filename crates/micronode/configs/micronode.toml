# RO:WHAT — Default Micronode config (beta profile).
# RO:WHY  — Workspace-local defaults for dev and smoke tests.
#           This file is safe to check in: it binds to localhost and
#           uses in-memory storage (amnesia-first).
# RO:INVARIANTS —
#   - Localhost-only bind.
#   - Dev routes enabled for quick smokes.
#   - Storage is in-memory (`engine = "mem"`) by default.
