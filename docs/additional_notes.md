#architectural notes 

Thirty-three crates + a microkernel enable very strong separation of concerns, but you only get it if interfaces are tight, dependencies are acyclic, and the kernel boundary is policed. Here‚Äôs how to tell if your 33-crate layout is delivering the goods (and what to fix if not).
What ‚Äúthorough separation‚Äù looks like (signals)
Acyclic graph: No crate cycles; the dependency graph is a DAG. Kernel at the root, leaves at the edge.
Narrow interfaces: Each crate exposes a small, stable API (types + traits), not internals.
Single reason to change: Every crate has one clear responsibility (high cohesion).
Replaceability: You could swap a crate‚Äôs implementation without touching dependents (LSP-style).
Capability passing instead of globals: Things like I/O, config, metrics, and bus handles are injected from the microkernel, not imported as singletons.
Independent tests: Each crate can be unit/integration tested on its own; cross-crate tests only exercise public contracts.

Yes ‚Äî here are the **six sections** that group the 16 blueprints:

---

### 1. **Runtime Safety**

* Concurrency & Aliasing
* Hardening
* Microkernel

---

### 2. **Interop & App Experience**

* Interop
* Omnigate
* App Integration

---

### 3. **Boundaries & Security**

* Scoping & Orthogonality
* Security & Privacy

---

### 4. **Verification & Scale**

* Testing & Verification
* Performance & Scaling

---

### 5. **Economics & Governance**

* Economic Integrity
* Governance & Lifecycle

---

### 6. **Usability & Operations**

* DX & Documentation
* Observability & Ops

---

These six act like **chapters** of your ‚Äúconstitution‚Äù ‚Äî each one covers a dimension of design that every crate/feature has to pass through.

#next note

Exactly ‚Äî that‚Äôs the right instinct. What Grok suggested is essentially extending what we already have into a **complete governance grid**. Right now, you‚Äôve got \~9 blueprints (Concurrency, Hardening, Microkernel, Interop, Omnigate, App Integration, Scoping, Security, Observability).

Grok‚Äôs list adds **Testing, Performance, Economic Integrity, Governance, DX/Docs**. That closes *all* the gaps. Let me give you a **God-tier synthesis**:

# üèõ RustyOnions Blueprint Suite (Final Form)

Every crate, feature, and PR must pass these **16 blueprint gates**.
No merges without sign-off across all relevant categories.
This is your **masterpiece checklist**.

---

## Runtime Safety

1. **Concurrency & Aliasing**
   ‚Ä£ No locks across `.await`
   ‚Ä£ Loom/TLA+ verification
   ‚Ä£ Backpressure documented

2. **Hardening**
   ‚Ä£ Timeouts, limits, input caps
   ‚Ä£ Replay/DoS resistance
   ‚Ä£ Sandbox risky code

3. **Microkernel**
   ‚Ä£ Kernel only supervises (no business logic)
   ‚Ä£ Frozen APIs (`Bus`, `KernelEvent`)
   ‚Ä£ Hot reload outside app logic

---

## Interop & App Experience

4. **Interop**
   ‚Ä£ ABNF grammar, test vectors
   ‚Ä£ DTO invariants with `deny_unknown_fields`
   ‚Ä£ Consistent error taxonomy

5. **Omnigate**
   ‚Ä£ DTO shaping separated from ingress enforcement
   ‚Ä£ Multi-tenant fair-queuing
   ‚Ä£ ZK hook compatibility

6. **App Integration**
   ‚Ä£ Micronode + Macronode defaults
   ‚Ä£ E2E opacity, PQ hybrid encryption
   ‚Ä£ SDK DX: runnable in <30 mins

---

## Boundaries & Security

7. **Scoping & Orthogonality**
   ‚Ä£ Unique reason per crate
   ‚Ä£ Explicit anti-scope documented
   ‚Ä£ No redundancy or drift

8. **Security & Privacy**
   ‚Ä£ PQ-hybrid key custody, zeroization
   ‚Ä£ No ambient authority (macaroons only)
   ‚Ä£ Metadata minimized

---

## Verification & Scale

9. **Testing & Verification**
   ‚Ä£ Property tests, fuzzing, model checks
   ‚Ä£ TLA+ specs for protocols
   ‚Ä£ Canary tests in CI

10. **Performance & Scaling**
    ‚Ä£ Benchmarks for every crate
    ‚Ä£ Load profiles, stress tests
    ‚Ä£ SLOs: p95 latency, throughput, error budgets

---

## Economics & Governance

11. **Economic Integrity**
    ‚Ä£ Conservation invariants (`Œ£ credits == debits`)
    ‚Ä£ No double-spends
    ‚Ä£ Receipts tamper-evident

12. **Governance & Lifecycle**
    ‚Ä£ Registry rules (availability‚Üíburn‚Üíclaim)
    ‚Ä£ Moderation/disputes SLAs
    ‚Ä£ Ads escrow lifecycles

---

## Usability & Operations

13. **DX & Documentation**
    ‚Ä£ Human-readable code, comments mandatory
    ‚Ä£ Quickstart guides, SDK examples
    ‚Ä£ Contributor onboarding flow

14. **Observability & Ops**
    ‚Ä£ Golden 4 metrics + domain metrics
    ‚Ä£ Alerts for quota storms, replay floods
    ‚Ä£ Dashboards with histograms & gauges

---

# ‚úÖ Golden Rule

If a crate, feature, or PR cannot **pass all applicable blueprint gates**, it doesn‚Äôt ship.
The checklists are not optional ‚Äî they are your **constitution**.

---

üëâ The way to implement this is:

* A `blueprints/` folder with **one Markdown checklist per blueprint**.
* A `Blueprint_Master_Index.md` at root linking them all.
* Every PR template includes a ‚ÄúBlueprint Compliance‚Äù section requiring reviewer ticks.

# new note regarding refactor and analysis of date for our refactor dump script we ran

What I recommend doing next (concrete)
Lock the order: ron-kernel ‚Üí naming ‚Üí ron-bus ‚Üí index ‚Üí transport ‚Üí ron-app-sdk.
For each top crate, add shims (deprecated re-exports) so dependents don‚Äôt break while you reshape internals.
From duplicates.txt, align obvious versions (e.g., crypto/TLS stack) so downstream patch diffs stay small during refactors.
If you want extra confidence, re-run the script later with:
RUN_API_SCAN=1 RUN_BUILD_TIME=1 BUILD_TIME_TOP=8 scripts/refactor_dump.sh out=refactor_full.md
(Gives API surface size + timing for the top 8 crates only ‚Äî fast but informative.)
If you‚Äôd like, send me just the top 30 lines of crates_ranked.csv (or the whole file), and I‚Äôll turn it into a step-by-step refactor plan with the exact shim signatures for each crate.

# most recent notes

Absolutely‚Äîhere‚Äôs the consolidated, scan-aware update. I‚Äôve locked the **33-crate roster** and mapped them to the **12 pillars** so you can refactor and review against a single source of truth.

# Updated crate list (canonical 33)

The list below applies your adds/merges/removals (e.g., **`ron-billing` ‚Üí folded into `ron-ledger`**; **deprecated crates dropped; `svc-edge` excluded** to avoid role overlap). &#x20;

1. ron-kernel
2. ron-bus
3. ryker
4. ron-policy
5. ron-kms
6. ron-auth
7. svc-passport
8. ron-audit
9. metrics
10. svc-gateway
11. omnigate
12. ron-app-sdk
13. oap
14. micronode
15. macronode
16. svc-storage
17. svc-index
18. naming
19. tldctl
20. svc-overlay
21. transport
22. svc-arti-transport
23. svc-mailbox
24. svc-sandbox
25. ron-ledger  (absorbs reporting/‚Äúbilling‚Äù)
26. svc-wallet
27. accounting
28. svc-rewarder
29. svc-registry
30. svc-mod
31. svc-ads
32. interop
33. ron-proto&#x20;

# The 12 pillars (boundary contracts) + crate mapping

These pillars are your review ‚Äúchapters.‚Äù Every crate/PR proves compliance against all relevant gates. &#x20;

1. **Kernel & Orchestration** ‚Äî lifecycle, supervision, backoff
   Crates: `ron-kernel`, `ron-bus`, `ryker`.
   Signals for good separation: tight interfaces, DAG deps, kernel at root.&#x20;

2. **Policy & Capability Control** ‚Äî decide, don‚Äôt execute
   Crates: `ron-policy` (quotas/pricing/splits; no side-effects).&#x20;

3. **Identity & Key Management** ‚Äî custody & authz
   Crates: `ron-kms`, `ron-auth`, `svc-passport`. PQ-hybrid & zeroization expectations live here.&#x20;

4. **Audit & Compliance** ‚Äî evidence, not metrics or money
   Crates: `ron-audit`. Tamper-evident receipts/trails.&#x20;

5. **Observability** ‚Äî health/metrics/tracing only
   Crates: `metrics`. No policy/evidence in here.&#x20;

6. **Ingress (Gateway)** ‚Äî neutral entry, enforcement/termination
   Crates: `svc-gateway`. (We explicitly keep **`svc-edge` out** to preserve clean roles.)&#x20;

7. **App BFF & SDK** ‚Äî DTO shaping & developer experience
   Crates: `omnigate`, `ron-app-sdk`, `oap`, `micronode`, `macronode`. Keep this distinct from ingress and ledger.&#x20;

8. **Content Addressing & Naming** ‚Äî storage vs. mapping vs. semantics
   Crates: `svc-storage`, `svc-index`, `naming`, `tldctl`. Preserve the trio boundary explicitly.&#x20;

9. **Overlay & Transport** ‚Äî moving bits (not storing them)
   Crates: `svc-overlay`, `transport`, `svc-arti-transport`, `svc-mailbox`.&#x20;

10. **Discovery / Relay / Safety** ‚Äî isolation, containment
    Crates: `svc-sandbox`. Not routing, not money‚Äîpure safety.&#x20;

11. **Economics & Wallets** ‚Äî value movement, usage accounting
    Crates: `ron-ledger` (money moves here; includes reporting), `svc-wallet`, `accounting`, `svc-rewarder` (ZK/commitment helper). Economic invariants apply (e.g., Œ£ credits == debits). &#x20;

12. **Governance & Interop** ‚Äî registry, moderation, ads, bridges, protocol
    Crates: `svc-registry`, `svc-mod`, `svc-ads`, `interop`, `ron-proto` (shared DTO/error contracts).&#x20;

# How this ties into refactor gates (what to enforce)

Use the same six ‚Äúconstitution‚Äù chapters and their concrete checks during PR review: Runtime Safety; Interop & App Experience; Boundaries & Security; Verification & Scale; Economics & Governance; Usability & Ops. Each chapter has explicit gates (e.g., **no locks across `.await`**, **deny\_unknown\_fields on DTOs**, **no ambient authority**, **SLOs**, **economic conservation**, **docs/metrics**). That checklist is already sketched and ready to apply to the crates above. &#x20;

# Enforcement glue (already drafted)

To make the pillars ‚Äúreal,‚Äù apply the lint wall + custom `xtask` checks and CI shown in your notes (Clippy hygiene, AST rules for public fields/finite enums/serde tags, **ASan/TSan**, **cargo-deny**, README sync, invariant-tag scan). This plugs directly into the pillars and prevents drift as you refactor.    &#x20;


* **No contrived roles.** Every crate has a single sentence that isn‚Äôt duplicative of another. If we can‚Äôt write that sentence, we removed it.
* **No math errors.** It‚Äôs a real 33, with deprecated libs out, ZK kept explicit (`svc-rewarder`), billing merged into ledger, and `ron-proto` kept as a cross-service contract surface.
* **Boundaries hold.** Storage‚â†Index‚â†Naming; Gateway‚â†Omnigate; Overlay‚â†Transport; Ledger‚â†Accounting; Policy decides, Ledger executes, Audit records, Metrics observes.
