RustyOnions is an experimental peer-to-peer platform built in Rust, designed to power a **decentralized, private, and fair internet**. It leverages a microkernel architecture and a two-plane design (public and private) to deliver scalable, privacy-first services with automatic micro-payments for creators, moderators, and operators. The project is in **active development** with a focus on robust TCP overlays, Tor integration, and scalable content distribution.

## üåü Microkernel Architecture

RustyOnions employs a lightweight microkernel (`ron-kernel`) that supervises isolated services, ensuring fault tolerance and modularity. Each service operates as an independent process, communicating via a process-local IPC bus (`ron-bus`) or a TCP+TLS overlay for distributed setups. The kernel remains minimal, handling supervision, configuration, metrics, and health checks without embedding application logic.

### Core Principles
- **Isolation:** Services (e.g., index, overlay, storage, mailbox) run as separate processes for security and reliability.
- **Bus-First IPC:** Local communication uses `ron-bus` (UDS + MessagePack); distributed services use TCP+TLS overlays.
- **Fault Tolerance:** The kernel monitors services, restarting them on failure and gating traffic via `/healthz` and `/readyz` endpoints.
- **Minimal Kernel:** The kernel focuses on supervision and metrics, leaving business logic to services.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Rust (stable toolchain)
- macOS or Linux
- Optional: Tor for private-plane messaging, Docker/Podman for containerized deployments

### Build
```bash
cargo build --workspace
```

### Run Kernel + Services (Local Development)
```bash
RON_SVC_INDEX_BIN=target/debug/svc-index \
RON_SVC_OVERLAY_BIN=target/debug/svc-overlay \
RON_SVC_STORAGE_BIN=target/debug/svc-storage \
cargo run -p ron-kernel
```

### Run Gateway (Public Plane)
```bash
export RON_INDEX_SOCK=/tmp/ron/svc-index.sock
export RON_OVERLAY_SOCK=/tmp/ron/svc-overlay.sock
export RON_STORAGE_SOCK=/tmp/ron/svc-storage.sock
cargo run -p gateway -- --bind 127.0.0.1:54087 --enforce-payments true
```

### Run Public Micro-Node (Systemd)
```bash
sudo cp deploy/systemd/ron-public.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo cp deploy/configs/config.public.toml /etc/ron/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now ron-public
```

Check health:
```bash
curl -sS http://localhost:9096/healthz
curl -sS http://localhost:9096/readyz
```

### Pin Content & Earn Rewards (MVP)
```bash
ronctl enroll --payout <ADDRESS>
ronctl pin tiles:world-zoom0-14-2025Q3
ronctl rewards receipt --epoch now --sign --submit
```

## üîë How It Works

RustyOnions splits operations into two planes:
- **Public Plane:** Handles content-addressed data (e.g., maps, media) with BLAKE3 verification and micro-payment routing.
- **Private Plane:** Provides end-to-end encrypted messaging over Tor (client/onion-only) for metadata protection.

### Key Features
- **Manifest.toml Attribution:** Every content address includes a `Manifest.toml` file with metadata and payout addresses, enabling automatic micro-payments to creators, moderators, and operators.
- **Content Addressing:** Assets (e.g., images, videos, posts) are hashed with BLAKE3 to create unique identifiers like `<hash>.image` or `<hash>.post`.
- **Token Economy:**
  - **Earn Tokens:** Contribute bandwidth, publish content, provide compute services (`.ai`, `.gpu`), or moderate content (`.mod`).
  - **Spend Tokens:** Access services (e.g., `.map`, `.traffic`), visit `.web3` sites, or consume media, with payments split among stakeholders.
- **Privacy-First Ads:** Tag-based, privacy-preserving ads with no cookies or tracking. Advertisers cannot target/exclude specific sites, ensuring free speech. A two-token model (ROX/ROC) funds the network.

### Example Manifest.toml
```toml
[meta]
tld = "music"
hash = "deadbeef1234567890abcd"
created = "2025-08-25T12:34:56Z"

[payload]
file = "track.av1"
BLAKE3: = "abcd1234..."
size = 8234567

[options]
chunks = true
resolutions = ["480p", "720p", "1080p"]
license = "CC-BY-4.0"
```

## ü¶Ä Addressing Scheme

RustyOnions uses a unique **crab-based URI format**:
```
ü¶Ä://<hash>.<tld>
```
- `<hash>`: A cryptographic hash (BLAKE3) identifying the content.
- `<tld>`: A functional namespace (e.g., `.music`, `.passport`, `.web3`).

### Examples
- `ü¶Ä://a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0.passport`: Identity/session manifest
- `ü¶Ä://deadbeefcafebabef00d1234.music`: Music or video stream
- `ü¶Ä://feedfeedfeedfeedfeed1234.blog`: Blog entry
- `ü¶Ä://1234567890abcdef12345678.news`: News article

Every address resolves to a `Manifest.toml` for metadata and attribution.

---

## üåê Special-Purpose TLDs

RustyOnions organizes services and content into purpose-specific TLDs:
- **Data & Mapping:** `.map`, `.traffic`
- **Web & Identity:** `.web3`, `.passport`
- **Compute Services:** `.ai`, `.gpu`, `.cpu`
- **Media:** `.image`, `.video`, `.music`, `.musicvideo`
- **Creator Economy:** `.creator`, `.mod`, `.journalist`, `.blogger`
- **Information:** `.news`, `.blog`, `.article`, `.post`, `.comment`
- **Music Ecosystem:** `.radio`, `.playlist`
- **Transparency:** `.alg` (algorithm transparency)

---

## üîí Privacy & Messaging

### Privacy Modes
- **TorStrict (Default):** End-to-end encrypted messaging over Tor (client/onion-only) for strong metadata protection. RustyOnions never runs Tor relays or exits.
- **RON-PM (Future):** Optional two-relay oblivious path with sealed-sender tokens, hiding sender IP from recipients without full Tor anonymity.

### Tor Policy
- Configured as `ClientOnly 1`, `ORPort 0`, `ExitPolicy reject *:*`.
- Optional onion services expose only your mailbox, not a relay.
- Firewalls and defaults prevent relay/dir port exposure.

See `docs/tor_policy.md` and `docs/private_messaging.md` for details.

---

## üìà Scaling

- **Single Host:** Multiple storage processes, sharded pinsets, periodic SHA-256 scrubs.
- **Small Cluster (2‚Äì10 Nodes):** L4 TCP load balancer to stateless gateways and storage pools, replicating signed bundles.
- **Future:** DHT provider discovery, consistent hashing, sharding, and optional erasure coding.

See `docs/scaling.md` and `deploy/alerts/rustyonions.yaml` for Prometheus alerts and SLOs.

---

## üß™ Current Status (Sep 3, 2025)

- **Public Plane:** Stable TCP+TLS overlay with GET streaming, quotas, and Prometheus metrics (`/metrics`, `/healthz`, `/readyz`).
- **Private Plane:** Tor client/onion-only integration with mailbox MVP.
- **Testing:** `test_tcp.sh` validates local overlays; `test_tor.sh` confirms Tor bootstrap.
- **Roadmap:** DHT discovery, sharding, RON-PM relays, challenge-based rewards.

## üß™ Test Scripts

### Local TCP Overlay
```bash
chmod +x testing/test_tcp.sh
./testing/test_tcp.sh
```

### Tor Bootstrap Smoke Test
```bash
chmod +x testing/test_tor.sh
./testing/test_tor.sh
# Optional: KEEP_TOR=1, AUTO_PORTS=1, TOR_BRIDGES=...
```

---

## ü¶Ä Node Usage (Work in Progress)

Run overlay (public plane):
```bash
RUST_LOG=info cargo run -p node -- serve --transport tcp
```

Run Tor client (private plane):
```bash
RUST_LOG=info cargo run -p node -- serve --transport tor
```

---

## üí∞ Rewards System (MVP)

Earn rewards by pinning content or serving traffic:
```bash
ronctl enroll --payout <ADDRESS>
ronctl pin tiles:world-zoom0-14-2025Q3
ronctl rewards receipt --epoch now --sign --submit
```

Future: Randomized chunk challenges, Merkle proofs, and ROX/ROC settlement.

See `docs/rewards.md`.

## üîÆ Future Features: Micronodes

Ultra-lightweight nodes for local mesh networks, offline handoffs, and disaster recovery. Micronodes will maintain the same manifest and attribution model with minimal resource usage (research phase).
