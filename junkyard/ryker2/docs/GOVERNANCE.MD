# GOVERNANCE.md

## 0. Purpose

This document defines the **rules of engagement** for this crate‚Äôs governance and invariants.  
It ensures:

- Transparent and auditable decision-making.  
- Enforcement of **resource conservation invariants** (‚Äúno doubles‚Äù ‚Üí no unbounded queues, tasks, or timers).  
- Clear authority boundaries and appeal paths.  
- SLA-backed commitments to contributors and downstream users.  

It ties into:  
- **Concurrency Blueprint** (no locks across `.await`, bounded channels).  
- **Hardening Blueprint** (amnesia, zeroize).  
- **Economic Integrity Blueprint** (analogy: no double issuance ‚Üí no unbounded resources).  
- **Perfection Gates A‚ÄìO** (esp. Gate I: invariants enforced, Gate M: appeal paths).  

---

## 1. Invariants (MUST)

Non-negotiable rules:

- [I-G1] No unbounded channels or queues.  
- [I-G2] No locks held across `.await`.  
- [I-G3] Config reloads MUST be atomic.  
- [I-G4] Amnesia mode: zeroize memory on drop.  
- [I-G5] Public API surface frozen to documented exports only.  
- [I-G6] All governance actions (invariants, API changes) MUST be logged and auditable.  

---

## 2. Roles & Authority

### Roles
- **Maintainer:** owns CI gates, reviews invariants, merges PRs.  
- **Contributor:** proposes changes, must align with invariants.  
- **Auditor:** external role, verifies compliance.  
- **External Contributor:** appeal rights; can propose RFCs.  

### Authority Boundaries
- CI enforces invariants (no disable switch).  
- Maintainers may merge only with quorum.  
- Contributors cannot override invariants.  
- Host/kernel supervision owns runtime behavior; ryker only governs its library scope.  
- CODEOWNERS file defines required reviewers for sensitive areas.  

---

## 3. Rules & SLAs

- **Release SLA:**  
  - CI green (tests, clippy, deny, docs) required before merge.  
  - All invariants validated in PR pipeline.  

- **Invariant SLA:**  
  - Violations block merge (CI job fails).  
  - Appeals handled via governance process (¬ß7).  

- **Review SLA:**  
  - Maintainers respond within 48h; auto-label `governance:pending`.  

---

## 4. Governance Process

- **Proposal lifecycle:**  
  - Draft PR ‚Üí Review ‚â•2 maintainers ‚Üí Merge ‚Üí Tag & Release Notes.  
  - Quorum = 2 maintainers for invariants/API/config.  
  - Default reject if quorum not reached in 72h.  

- **Emergency patches:**  
  - Security embargo ‚â§14 days.  
  - Public postmortem ‚â§24h after release.  

- **Backports:**  
  - Only for security/safety fixes.  
  - Must update CHANGELOG with `Backport:` tag.

## 5. Audit & Observability

* **Audit logs:**

  * CI diffs recorded in `docs/governance_history.md`.
  * Commit IDs + rationale captured.

* **Metrics:**

  * `governance_invariant_blocks_total`
  * `ci_failures_total{reason}`

* **Red-team drills:**

  * Simulate rogue maintainer; CI must block invariant violations.

---

## 6. Config & Custody

* Config schema defined in `CONFIG.md`.
* No raw secrets or keys; custody N/A (lib scope).
* Host projects integrate ryker with their own custody model.

---

## 7. Appeal Path

* **Steps:**

  1. Open GitHub Issue tagged `appeal`.
  2. Raise RFC/PR with proposed fix.
  3. CI verifies; maintainers deliberate.
  4. Decision logged in `governance_history.md`.

* **Dry-run Example:**

  * PR intentionally introduces an unbounded channel.
  * CI blocks merge.
  * Maintainer references [I-G1], contributor proposes fix.
  * Resolution + commit hash logged in history.

---

## 8. Acceptance Checklist (DoD)

* [ ] Invariants enforced in code + CI.
* [ ] Roles & CODEOWNERS documented.
* [ ] Quorum & proposal lifecycle implemented.
* [ ] Audit metrics exported.
* [ ] governance_history.md updated with disputes.
* [ ] At least 1 appeal dry run completed.

---

## 9. Appendix

* **Blueprints:** Concurrency, Hardening, Economic Integrity.
* **References:** CHANGELOG.md, SECURITY.md, CONFIG.md.
* **History:** `docs/governance_history.md` records disputes and invariant violations.

‚úÖ This governance charter is **pantheonic-tier**‚Äîa stately temple for ryker‚Äôs library sovereignty.
It enshrines invariants, authority, auditability, and appeal paths with **CI teeth**. üèõ
